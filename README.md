# About me
I am currently a second year research assistant in the Autonomous Robtoics and Percetions Group (ARPG) at the University of Colorado Boulder in the Computer Science Department. My advisor is Christoffer Heckman and I work primarily in verified controls and autonomy.

## Background and Areas of Interest
At a high level my research consists of generation of Control Lyapunov Functions and Control Barrier Functions to generate a library of manuevers, and then piecing together the manuevers to generate executable paths or trajectories for a vehicle to follow. 

I work with a variety of vehicle dynmaics models, SLAM algorithms, Deep Learning Models, sensor data, and hardware to generate and test these functions. I am interested in developing usable verified control models and integrating them into existng systems to provide superior performance and safety guarantees over existing models.

## Publications
We are in the submission process for my recent work! The work builds on recent CLF generation and control extraton methods such as:

* Chang et al. "Neural Lyapunov Control",<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00611"> Link </a>

## Experience 
I worked at Boeing as a Network Design Engineer for 4 years before returning to school to pursue my PhD. I specialized in CANBUS, Ethernet and ARINC 429 design and troubleshooting. I was a Boeing designated expert in CANBUS and lead the CANBUS Interprise Produce Team.

M.S. Electrical Engineering, 2019, University of Washington

B.S. Electrical Engineering, 2017, Gonzaga University

## Other
Outside of work I am an avid skier and golfer. I enjoy skiing in the backcountry as much as I do on the resort, and you might catch me cycling in the summer to try to stay in shape!
