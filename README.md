# Background and Areas of Interest
The focus of my research at CU is verified autonomy and controls. I synthesize Control Lyapunov Functions and Control Barrier Functions to generate a library of manuevers and then piece together the manuevers to generate executable paths or trajectories to follow. 

I work with a variety of vehicle dynmaics models, SLAM algorithms, Deep Learning Models, Sensor data and hardware to generate and test these functions. 


##Experience 
I worked at Boeing as a Network Design Engineer for 4 years before returning to school to pursue my PhD. I specialized in CANBUS, Ethernet and ARINC 429 design and troubleshooting. I was a Boeing designated expert in CANBUS and lead the CANBUS Interprise Produce Team.
